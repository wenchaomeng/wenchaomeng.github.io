/proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory
              This file contains the kernel virtual memory accounting mode. Values are:
              0: heuristic overcommit (this is the default)
              1: always overcommit, never check
              2: always check, never overcommit
              In mode 0, calls of mmap(2) with MAP_NORESERVE set are not checked, and the default check is very weak, leading to the risk of getting a process "OOM-killed".  Under Linux 2.4
              any non-zero value implies mode 1.  In mode 2 (available since Linux 2.6), the total virtual address space on the system is limited to (SS + RAM*(r/100)), where SS is the size
              of the swap space, and RAM is the size of the physical memory, and r is the contents of the file /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_ratio.
